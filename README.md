# Open Humans Nokia Health data integration project

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Treblesteph/oh-nokiahealth-integration.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Treblesteph/oh-nokiahealth-integration)

*This is a Django/Celery application which takes the user through authorization steps with Open Humans and Nokia Health and and then adds their Nokia Health data into their Open Humans account.*

The app is live and deployed with Heroku: http://oh-nokiahealth-integration.herokuapp.com/

This repo is based on the Open Humans [data demo template project](https://github.com/OpenHumans/oh-data-demo-template). It uses the Nokia Health [API](https://developer.health.nokia.com/api) to get personal body, sleep, and activity data.
