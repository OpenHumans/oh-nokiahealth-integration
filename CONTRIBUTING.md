# How-to contribute
First of all: You are awesome for wanting to contribute to this project. Thank you so much for this! üéâ üçæ üòç. Making it easy for people to start their own projects on Open Humans is a daring but important and satisfying task! Learn more about the ways you can contribute here:

## [Reporting issues](https://github.com/OpenHumans/oh-nokiahealth-integration/issues)

This is the easiest way to contribute but also one of the most important ones. If we don't know that something is broken we can't fix it! So, something does not work as you expected? The `README.md` is unclear or - even worse - just wrong? Please let us know by [opening an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/OpenHumans/oh-nokiahealth-integration/issues) and we will look into it as soon as possible.


## Fixing existing problems
You [read through our issues or create your own one](https://github.com/OpenHumans/oh-nokiahealth-integration/issues) and you happen to know the solution to it? And even better, you want to contribute the solution? We are [happy to accept your pull requests](https://github.com/OpenHumans/oh-nokiahealth-integration/pulls), checkout the SETUP.md to get started working on this repo. Ideally pull requests should just tackle a single issue at a time and come with a description of what will be fixed and how.

## Contributing new features.
If you have new feature ideas that aren't on the list yet: Please be in touch, we'd be thrilled to discuss these.
